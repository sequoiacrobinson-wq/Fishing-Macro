Standard library only, on purpose: this has to run *before* anything imports
numpy or opencv, so it cannot depend on them itself.

Without this, launching the bot on a fresh machine — or hitting the Run button
in an editor — fails with a bare `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`,
which tells a non-technical user nothing at all.
