  * `read_bar`   — given a located bar, extracts zone / fish / progress from a

    The main path starts from a green blob, which quietly assumes the zone is
    green when we go looking. It is not always: while the fish is outside it
    the game desaturates the zone, and a sustained escape fades it to a fully
    neutral grey. Measured on one recording, in the band rows where the bar
    plainly was, the strict `zone_mask` matched **zero** pixels while the
    tracking mask matched 240-327 per row — so `find_bar` had no candidate to
    start from and reported no minigame for 1252 of 1256 frames.

    That is the worst possible time to go blind. The bot arrives here right
    after a bite, and if the zone is grey for the whole `bite_to_bar_timeout`
    it never acquires the bar, gives up, and recasts into a live fight.

    The progress strip has no such problem: nothing is ever drawn over it and
    it does not change color, which is why it is already the thing that
    *confirms* a candidate. Here it becomes the thing that finds one. Walk up
    from the strip while the rows still look like bar (dark track, zone in
