"""Reel controller.

The zone is a double integrator driven by a binary input:

    z'' = +a   while LMB is held      (measured +0.95 px/frame^2)
    z'' = -a   while LMB is up        (measured -0.93 px/frame^2)

with |z'| saturating around 0.545 track widths/s. The fish moves at a constant
speed and reverses at random.

Time-optimal tracking of a moving target for that plant is bang-bang on the
switching curve:

    e  = x_fish - z
    ev = v_fish - v_zone
    s  = e + 0.5 * ev * |ev| / a
    hold if s > 0 else release

`s > 0` reads as "even if I started braking now I would still land short of the
fish", so keep accelerating right. Near s = 0 the law chatters at the loop rate;
that is desirable — a ~50 % duty cycle averages to zero net acceleration and the
zone coasts alongside the fish.

Everything is in *track widths* so the same numbers work at any resolution.
